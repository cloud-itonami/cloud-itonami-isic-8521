  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the secondary-education analog of
  `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- student intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-assess  -- adds jurisdiction assessment +
                                 academic-integrity screening writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:student/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:grading/
                                 finalize`/`:graduation/finalize`
                                 NEVER auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:grading/finalize`/`:graduation/finalize` are deliberately ABSENT
  from every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent
  structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Finalizing a
  real grading and finalizing a real graduation are the two real-world
  legal acts this actor performs; both are always a human licensed
  educator's call. `secondary.governor`'s `:actuation/finalize-
  grading`/`:actuation/finalize-graduation` high-stakes gate enforces
  the same invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on
  this. `:academic-integrity/screen` is likewise never auto-eligible,
  at any phase -- the same posture every sibling's screening op has.
  Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE member (`:student/intake`)
  -- this domain has no separate no-capital-risk 'file' lifecycle
  distinct from the student record itself.")
